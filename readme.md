- Strings
- Regular Expressions
- Finite Automata (DFA and NFA)
- more to come...

## Implementations

The `implementations` directory contains code examples and implementations of various automata and formal language concepts. Each implementation is accompanied by a detailed explanation and usage instructions.

## Notes

The `notes` directory includes comprehensive notes on the theory of automata and formal languages. These notes are intended to provide a deeper understanding of the concepts and are a great resource for revision and study.
